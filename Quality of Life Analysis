On student login class, have table display 4 different result sets based on 4 reworked buttons.
  -One button for Student Info, which is shown by default
  -One button for all couse Info
  -One button to show course in which student is enrolled
  -One button that will calculate the GPA
  
Create a separate class called Math, that will receive an int array parameter and process the average grade.
