4/18/2018 - Uploaded prototype GUI and framework of program to identify basic requirements. 
Needs architecture diagram, use case diagram, workflow, artifacts

Notes:
		- I did not include the option to create and sign into an account as I do not know if it is necessary.
		However, it can easily be added.  -This is a requirement for him.  To be able to login and have a module check
		if the person is an administrator or a regular user(student) checking their statuses.
        
		-The name listed in the administrator form was put there to test the delete function;
		it is not connected to anything.
    
		-Waterfall model is probably the best way to go for this project, in my opinion
		-We should use a modern development life-cycle.  Waterfall is a classical model, and we may lose points for the
		old paradigm.  Reading the professors word doc, it seems like he wants the 4 major workflows of increment and iterative:
			-requirements
			-analysis
			-design
			-implementation.  
			
		We've already got requirements knocked out I think.  Unless something is missing.  I'll start working out something for
	analysis today and we can make sure they line up by this afternoon.  
		Tomorrow we can knock out design workflow and get a UML going.  I've done some research, there are some templates floating 
	around that we can modify to fit our needs.  Modules and everything.
		Then we'll have the weekend to puzzle together code for implementation, leaving monday and tuesday for testing.


I'm going to do what I can to knock out the rest of the project tomorrow so that we can be ready for the presentation on Wednesday. I can
take take care of the program if you want to finish the written portion, or vise versa.

At this point, I have completed the project in it's entirety.  I will be presenting by myself tomorrow. Good luck.
