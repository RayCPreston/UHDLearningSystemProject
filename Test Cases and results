Testing the whole application with the following:
  At Login:
    use known credentials User and Pass
    use unknown user and pass
    use known user but incorrect pass
    use unknown user but known pass
    use int
    use negatives
    use null
      -Everything functions as specified in design and analysis-

At Student data:

  All buttons work as proposed, test cases are commented out in studentLogin file.
  Still need to find a way to bring txtUsername variable from Login class so user doesn't have to reinput username.  Can currently
access records for all students.
  
At AdminLogin
  All buttons work as proposed test cases commented out.  Need to find a method to highlight all text on click focus.  Quality of life
