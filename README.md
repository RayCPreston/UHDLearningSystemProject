# UHDLearningSystemProject

Here's the basic description for the project. You guys let me know if it needs any work done to it.

Making a Learning Management System. It tracks one semester at a time, so that should make this pretty
easy, we should be able to test with just our group and if everything works well, we can use the class
roster for the in class demo on the 25th. The project is going to keep track of various information
about students. There will be limited algorithms necessary, it will be mostly just a data output program.
The program will work as an offline application and users will be able to log in provided they are students
or instructors in the same database outputting the information stated above.
