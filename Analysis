  The LMS will have the following requirements, which can be translated into a UML diagram so the tasks can be divided up between the 5 group members.

-Project will need a GUI login and display screen
-A database or similar file with similar functionality that will keep track of the following data. 
  -Student Name. 
  -Student ID. 
  -Registered semester courses. 
  -Each exam score, for each course 
  -GPA calculations 
  -Separate login credentials: basic user, and administrator.
  
  As I currently see it, this can all be done in Visual Studio and SQL Server.  I don't know what everyone is comfortable with, 
so please sound off if something sounds up your alley.  There should be plenty of open source code to help us out anyways.
          
-Make the database, it should be relatively easy considering the limited tables and columns.
          For the GPA calculation
-Make an algorithm that will calculate GPA.
-Function to connect to database.
-Function to read grade records into variables for processing.
          For the login GUI
-Make the GUI, nothing fancy, just fields for USER, PASS, a LOGIN button, and a CLOSE/CANCEL button.
-Funtion to pass entered data to User and Pass variables.
-Function to check database access levels with User and Pass variables.
-Once credentials verified, there needs to be a second GUI where you can select what data to have displayed.  Will return
   SQL table.  This can all be check boxes that will get stuck in the SELECT statement.  Since there's only one semester to deal
   with, there won't be a need to deal with that user input.
   
   --I have to get back to work for a little bit.  Please feel free to add anything else or make changes.  Deadline's coming--
